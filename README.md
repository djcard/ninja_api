# ninja_api
A demo site created using Coldbox API

Used at several conferences in 2023 such as Into The Box and CFCamp. 

The best way to install this is to use CommandBox and run

`install ninja-api`

in an empty folder then run `install` to install dependencies.

The site will open at `http://ninjaapi.local` on port 80.
